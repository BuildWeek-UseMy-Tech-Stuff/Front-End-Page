# Use My Tech Stuff (November 2019 - Lambda Build Week)!

## Team:
UI: Corell Brown and Anthony Streett
React1: Bryan Adams and Arin Ramer
React2: David Delfaus
Backend: Daniel Firpo
Project Lead: Wesley White

## Proposal:
Nobody likes paying full price for items they're going to use only a few times. Rent your items from real people like you who have extra tech laying around.


- What problem does your app solve?  
    Allow users who have unused equipment to make a profit by loaning it.
    Allow users to have access to technology without the high cost of purchasing equipment.

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
    
	By giving owners the ability to rent out equipment, and giving users the ability to use the equipment without the high purchasing costs. 


- What is the mission statement?
    Saving people money, making people money.


## Features:

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
    Users can create a profile, login, add listings for rent, update listings for rent, delete listing for rent and rent items.

- What features may you wish to put in a future release?
    User messaging, user reviews, Calendar and Google Map integration, native mobile app.

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
    AirBNB: lets users rent out their living spaces, Craigslist: lets users buy and sell technology, VRBO: provides access to rentals, Mac In the Cloud: Allows users to rent remote usage of a Mac computer.


## Frameworks - Libraries:

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
    React, Material, Redux, Yup, Styled Components, Formik, FormikMaterialFields,

- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
No, it's our API

- Are you required to pay to use the API?
No, our API


- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
    No.

## Target Audience:

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.
    Those who would like to make income on equipment that's not being used. Those who need access to technology, but no money, or would prefer not to purchase the technology.


- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?  
	Everyone loves it, best site every 10/10

- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
	No, who's even used our app


## Research:

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.


## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully.**

This is a team assignment with individual assessments. All work must be your own but remember to collaborate with everyone on your team. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint and there is a score on overall teamwork. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.


## Commits

In case you ever need to return to old code. Remember your **ABC: Always Be Committing!**


## Project Set Up

Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:

- [ ]  Clone your OWN version of Repo.
- [ ]  Create a new Branch on the clone: `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ]  Implement the project on this branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ]  Push commits: `git push origin <firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ]  **LOOK** at your project directory and notice it's just a plain ol' React App that we've built using `create-react-app`.
- [ ]  **RUN** `yarn install` or `npm install` to retrieve the client-side dependencies.
- [ ]  **RUN** `yarn start` or `npm start` to fire up your React application.
- [ ] **RUN** `yarn add` or `npm i` to add frameworks and libraries needed for your project (i.e. redux, formik, yup, react-router-dom, etc.).


## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- Two user types: Equipment Owners and Renters
- Users can log in and create a profile. 
- They can then set up items they have for rent such as cameras, TVs, Party equipment like speakers/fog machines etc. 
- Users will be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete rental data. - A 2nd user can log in and see items that users have for rent and ask to rent an item.

STRETCH
Add a payment option into the application allowing people to pay over paypal/stripe etc. to rent their items, schedule time and place for pick up etc. Add a review system into the app so that the social aspect is there to ensure that users are legit.
